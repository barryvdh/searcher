# Searcher [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/krzysztof-gzocha/searcher.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/krzysztof-gzocha/searcher)

### What is that?
*Searcher* is a library created in order to simplify construction of complex searching queries basing on passed models.
It's basic idea is to split each searching *filter* to separate class.
Supported PHP versions: >=5.4, 7 and HHVM.

### Installation
You can install the library via composer by typing:
```
composer require krzysztof-gzocha/searcher
```

### Integration
Integration with Symfony is done in [SearcherBundle](https://github.com/krzysztof-gzocha/searcher-bundle)

### Idea
 - `FilterImposer` - will *impose* new conditions for single model
 - `FilterModel` - model that will be passed to `FilterImposer`. It will be populated from (for example) user input
 - `SearchingContext` - context of single search. This service holds something called `QueryBuilder`, but it can be anything that works for you. This is an abstraction layer between search and database. There is different context for Doctrine's ORM, ODM*, FOS Elastica* and so on. (* to be implemented). This service should know how to fetch results from constructed query,
 - `Searcher` - holds collection of `FilterImposer`'s and will pass `FilterModel`'s to apropriate `FilterImposer`s.
